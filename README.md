## Background:
This repository is a coded and visualized analysis with line graphs that show the trends on how decriminlization of drugs impact the crime rates in the state of Oregon, Washington, and even nationally.

  This repository contains the following:
  - ***Crime_analysis.ipynb:*** Jupyter notebook that analyzes all the information that was listed in the description plus more, such as percentages of total violations, year vs. each indivual crime violation, etc
  - ***API Data Extraction.ipynb:***
  - ***.gitignore:*** A file that protects our API keys
  - ***Data***
  - ***national_data.csv:*** A CSV file that contains the data of national crime violation by year and the counts of each individual crime such as, aggravated assult, DUIs, fraud, list goes on
  - ***oregon_data.csv:*** A CSV file that contains the data of Oregon's crime violation by year and the counts of each individual crime such as, burglary, theft, vandalism, etc
  - ***washington_data.csv:*** A CSV file that contains data of Washington's crime violation by year and the individual crimes commited by count

### WRITTEN ANALYSIS
As shown in the line charts provided for Oregon state, aggravated assault, weapon carrying, and plenty of other crime violations wasn’t much of an issue like drug abuse was. Both aggravated assault, weapon carrying, and other crime violations were kept under a count of 5,000 for over a decade. As for drug abuse it was at an all time high count of 20,000 around 2011 and 2013. Do keep in mind that Oregon state has had marijuana decriminalized since 1973. Even though there was a significant drop on the amount of violations in 2013 and 2014 at a count of 10,000, it still remained pretty high throughout the years of 2014 up until 2019 ranging from a count of 12,500 and 15,000. The count of violations dropped back down to 10,000 when Oregon voters passed a ballot measure to decriminalize possession of small amounts of drugs which include heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Under this measure, possession of up to a personal-use amount of any drug is a violation punishable by a $100 fine or a health assessment. The measure also created a new fund to provide addiction treatment and other services. 

The line charts shown for Washington state were similar to Oregon when it came to drug abuse violations. Although the numbers aren’t quite the same, they’re still very high and around the same range of numbers. Washington drug abuse violation counts all time high was at 14,000. Which then dropped down to 11,000 to 12,000 throughout the years of 2013-2016. Spiking up again over a couple hundreds, even a thousand after 2016 till 2019. When 2020 came around those numbers dropped down to 8,000. Which is pretty good progress for the state in comparison to over a decade ago. Washington state had decriminalized marijuana in 2012 as for small amounts of other drugs in 2021. Washington’s weapon carrying and other crime violations didn’t seem to be much of an issue based on the fact that the counts were kept at 2,000 and under for a decade. As for their aggravated assault violations, the count started at 4,000 as it progressively went up to 6,000. 

From a viewpoint of the nation as a whole, states are able to decide for themselves on legalization for certain drugs, all drugs are still illegal on a federal level. From the line graph shown, again as both that were shown for Oregon and Washington state, drug abuse seems to be one of the biggest crime violations that is committed. In 2011 the drug abuse violation count started at 12,000, spiking up to 14,000 in 2014 but gradually going down to 10,000 when 2020 comes. The violation count for aggravated assault was right in between 2,000 to 4,000 over the years, while weapon carrying, and other violation counts were under 2,000.
